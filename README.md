This project was designed not only to strengthen the foundations of Python but also to introduce and build a solid basis in machine learning. 
The main goal of the project was to use data collected from an accelerometer to identify the type of fall performed through machine learning techniques. 
The dataset used was properly labeled and analyzed, and by testing several different machine learning models, the objective was to achieve the best possible results.
